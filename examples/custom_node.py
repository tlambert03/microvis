"""An example of creating a custom node that can be added to a scene.

This is a very simple example, but it shows how to extend the base Node class (or
any of the other core classes) to create a custom node that can be added to a
scene.  It boils down to two steps:

1. Subclass `core.Node` and add class attributes with annotations defining your
   model (just like a dataclass or pydantic model).
2. Add a class attribute `BACKEND_ADAPTORS` that is a mapping of backend names to
   a backend adaptor classes (see next step for an explanation of what that is).
3. Implement one or more backend adaptor classes that implement the backend
   protocol for your new node.  Specifically, this means implementing `_viz_set_<name>`
   methods for each attribute in your model.

In the example below, a very simple "points" layer is created.  It has a single
attribute, `size`, that controls the size of the points. It is only implemented for
vispy.

# we should consider making a public API for this, or at least making certain attributes
# public (like, `native` here).
