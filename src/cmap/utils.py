    The test image consists of a sine wave superimposed on a ramp function The
    amplitude of the sine wave is modulated from its full value at the top of the
    image to 0 at the bottom.

    The image is useful for evaluating the effectiveness of different color maps.
    Ideally the sine wave pattern should be equally discernible over the full
    range of the color map.  In addition, across the bottom of the image, one
    should not see any identifiable features as the underlying signal is a smooth
    ramp.  In practice many color maps have uneven perceptual contrast over their
    range and often include 'flat spots' of no perceptual contrast that can hide
    significant features.

    Parameters
    ----------
    shape : tuple, optional
        [rows cols] specifying size of test image.  If a single value is supplied
        the image is square. Defaults to [256 512];  Note the number of columns is
        nominal and will be ajusted so that there are an integer number of sine wave
        cycles across the image.
    amp : float, optional
        Amplitude of sine wave. Defaults to 12.5
    wavelen : float, optional
        Wavelength of sine wave in pixels. Defaults to 8.
    power : float, optional
        Power to which the linear attenuation of amplitude, from top to bottom, is
        raised.  For no attenuation use p = 0.  For linear attenuation use a value
        of 1.  For contrast sensitivity experiments use larger values of p.  The
        default value is 2.

    The test image is a circular pattern consistsing of a sine wave superimposed
    on a spiral ramp function.  The spiral ramp starts at a value of 0 pointing
    right, increasing anti-clockwise to a value of 2*pi as it completes the full
    circle. This gives a 2*pi discontinuity on the right side of the image.  The
    amplitude of the superimposed sine wave is modulated from its full value at
    the outside of the circular pattern to 0 at the centre.  The default sine wave
    amplitude of pi/10 means that the overall size of the sine wave from peak to
    trough represents 2*(pi/10)/(2*pi) = 10% of the total spiral ramp of 2*pi.  If
    you are testing your colour map over a cycle of pi you should use amp = pi/20
    to obtain an equivalent ratio of sine wave to circular ramp.

    The image is designed for evaluating the effectiveness of cyclic colour maps.
    It is the cyclic companion to `sineramp`.  Ideally the sine wave pattern should
    be equally discernible over all angles around the test image.  In practice
    many colourmaps have uneven perceptual contrast over their range and often
    include 'flat spots' of no perceptual contrast that can hide significant
    features (e.g. hsv colour map).

    Parameters
    ----------
    size : int, optional
        Size of one side of the test image.  Defaults to 512.
    amp : float, optional
        Amplitude of sine wave. Defaults to 12.5
    wavelen : float, optional
        Wavelength of sine wave in pixels. Defaults to 8.
    power : float, optional
        Power to which the linear attenuation of amplitude, from top to bottom, is
        raised.  For no attenuation use p = 0.  For linear attenuation use a value
        of 1.  For contrast sensitivity experiments use larger values of p.  The
        default value is 2.
    hole : bool, optional
        If True, the test image will have a hole in the centre.  Defaults to True.
